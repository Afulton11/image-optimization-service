# Lambda Image Processing

A function that processes images from an original-images s3 bucket and places the processed image into an image-variants s3 bucket.

The "image-processing" lambda based off the one of the same name in the AWS image-optimization article: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/image-optimization-using-amazon-cloudfront-and-aws-lambda/>
